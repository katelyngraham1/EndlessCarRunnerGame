# Mobile Applications Development 3

For my 3rd year module, I was tasked with developing a game that was designed by one of my classmates. Throughout the development process, I maintained a developer diary and created comprehensive test plans, ensuring that all requirements were met. If you're interested in seeing the game in action, you can find a video of gameplay at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOFVCX9QWW0" target="_blank">link</a>
